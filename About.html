  <div id="text" >Hey there fellow coders! I am a senior in high school. I attend Pathways in Technology Early College High School. My school can really help you succeed in life at a young age very quickly. Due to the partnership my school has with City-Tech, my school is able to give students a chance to earn a free scholarship fully paid for. Also, we have a partnership with IBM,which offers an internship when you reach junior year.If all goes well at the internship,and you graduate from city tech,you are first in line for any job positions at IBM. </div>
